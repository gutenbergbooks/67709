<h2 class="nobreak">SYMPTOMS OF LOVE.</h2>
</div>


<p>Many young people, particularly of the male
kind, imagine themselves in love when in truth
they are not. Their supposed passion is but a
fancy of the moment. An ardent young man
is introduced to a pretty or interesting girl, and
after a quarter of an hour’s conversation is (in
his own opinion) over head and ears in love
with her. If he is a sensible man he will not
betray his weakness, for should the result prove
the correctness of his first impression, there can
be no harm of concealing the sudden passion.
If, on the contrary, he declares his partiality,
either by words or absurd behavior, the flirt, if
she be sensible, will be apt to look upon him
with distrust, or as a silly fellow with little or
no stability of character. It is impossible to
know that you have a genuine feeling of love
until long and intimate relations reveal to you
the ways, the disposition, and even the inmost
thoughts of the heart of your companion. Supposing,
then, that there is no deception on either
side&mdash;that two lovers have faithfully laid open
their most secret feelings, and mutually understand
each other’s tastes, dislikes, peculiarities
and habits. If all this knowledge increases
rather than diminishes their friendship, they
may then begin to suspect that they are in love.
If all young couples would strictly adhere to
this test before thinking of matrimony, there
would be few ill-assorted matches and a great
many more happy homes.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Flattery.</h2>
</div>


<p>This is a powerful weapon in the art of making
love. Never lived there yet man or woman
but what in some way or other could be flattered.
The great point is to know in what way
to use it. There is a time and a place to use it.
A young lady will feel flattered if you get a
chance, young man, to tell her mother about
the good qualities of her daughter; never fear
but the daughter will hear of it, for women
cannot keep a secret.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Trying your Lover.</h2>
</div>


<p>Young ladies very often exercise a good deal
of tact in trying a young man’s love. They
will act different from what the real feelings of
their hearts would be, simply to try a young
man’s pluck, if I must so call it. Young men,
don’t weary in well doing, you know that “faint
heart never won fair lady.” Do not put too
much stress upon any little remark a young
lady may make, for she often means directly
the reverse, especially if she is very young.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">How to be a Favorite with the Opposite Sex.</h2>
</div>


<p>It will be observed that when a young man
first finds himself in the company of the fair
sex he is seldom free from a degree of bashfulness,
which renders him peculiarly awkward,
and he scarcely knows what he is doing or
saying, and I have known many such to commit
errors that were truly laughable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[4]</span></p>

<p>Gentlemen will, on every suitable occasion,
offer civilities to ladies of their acquaintance,
especially to those for whom they may have a
particular attachment. A gentleman meeting
a lady is struck with her appearance, and
wishes to become better acquainted. Now, before
making any advances, you should find out
from some friend whether she is engaged, or if
any gentleman is paying particular attention to
her&mdash;this might save you much future trouble.</p>

<p>Finding she is not thus circumstanced, you
call her by name, and say, “Would it be agreeable
to you for us to cultivate a more intimate
acquaintance?” You need not say it in a tone
as serious as if you were going to a funeral;
but in a light, easy, peaceful way, as though
half in fun. You must not feel disappointed if
she tells you such words as, “Well, we will see
about it,” or “Some other time we will talk it
over.” Something in this style will not be out
of place, for she may not be expecting anything
of the kind and does not wish to give too prompt
an answer. If on any certain occasion you ask
a lady for her company, and she should say
that she is engaged, do not think anything
strange of it, for such may be the case; and
you must never let a lady see that you feel
disappointed at any time about such matters.</p>

<p>Gentlemen too often make themselves fools
about ladies or a certain lady, and the consequence
is the ladies have their own fun laughing
at them. Never make yourself a fool for
any lady, for it <a id="Ref_4" href="#BRef_4">won’t</a>  pay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[5]</span></p>

<p>It is too often the case that young men amuse
themselves by playing with the feelings of
young ladies. They visit them often, they walk
with them, pay them divers attentions, and
after giving them an idea that they are attached
to them, they either leave them, or, what is
worse, never come to an explanation of their
sentiments. This is nothing less than acting
the scoundrel; it is truly dastardly&mdash;infamous.
This has been the cause of many a young and
warm-hearted girl pining away by inches, to
fill a premature grave.</p>

<p>Young ladies should never thus allow themselves
to be trifled with. When a gentleman
pays you attentions for a length of time without
giving you to understand what he wants&mdash;make
him come to the point, do not be backward, or
it may be your ruin.</p>

<p>Very often you can bring a young man to
the point by getting a little careless when he
comes to see you. You must appear to be
more interested in something else. This will
make him feel very uneasy, I can assure you,
if he loves you any, and if he don’t love you he
has no right to be acting so, for this simple fact
may keep some other young man from courting
who would make a better husband. This is
common sense, and you should bear it in mind.
If this does not bring him to the point, you can
take your chance, and tell him that a proper
respect for yourself compels you to ask him his
object in visiting you. Tell him that your
friends and his are talking about it, and that it
is time you had an understanding.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[6]</span></p>

<p>Never marry unless you love, and are loved
in return; for without love no happiness, and
love that comes not before marriage comes not
in a lifetime. It is not right to give an immediate
answer when your hand is solicited in
marriage. You should tell the gentleman that
you had not been expecting a proposition of
the kind, and wish a little time to study the
matter over, and that you will give him an
answer by some stated time, which you can
mention. This will make the affair more interesting
to all parties. In the meantime ask your
parents their opinion on the subject.</p>

<p>When the appointed time comes be certain
you have your answer ready, or else he might
think you were coquetting him.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Love and Love-making.</h2>
</div>


<p>A chapter on Love! Can there be one so
bold as to essay a description of love in prose?
Nay, leave it to the poet, the painter; but common
prose is surely all unfit for such a theme.
So will the young say; but as we are now old,
we may have the boldness to write of love in
humble prose, and to look at it in that prosaic
aspect in which prudence and the cooler blood
of experience have brought us to regard it.</p>

<p>Love! what is it? It is as the perfume of
the flower, the song of the bird, the dew of the
morning, the glorious sun of the summer’s day&mdash;such
is love to life. Fragile as a gossamer
web&mdash;a vapor which a breath dispels; but
withal as the sea, whose soundings cannot be<span class="pagenum">[7]</span>
taken for the depth thereof. It is difficult to
say at what period of early life the gentle-winged
god’s influence is most to be guarded
against. The young and blooming girl, just
budding into womanhood, feels his power, but
does not to herself even acknowledge it; nay,
she scarcely knows his presence. All unused
as she is to the arts of Love, how can she
readily recognize his secret magic? She is introduced
to society; the novelty of her dress,
the display of her charms, hitherto concealed,
the care her <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">modiste</i> takes with that dress, for
the fuller development of each beauty, are all
new to her. She goes forth to the world all
bewilderment; the child of the school-room
to-day, to-morrow arrays herself to conquer
and be conquered. Thus far is simple; thus
far is what many mothers consider it their duty
to attend to, and leave the rest to fate. But
love is a deep study to those who would read it
well and understand it. The delicate-minded
maiden blushes, even when alone, when first
she confesses to herself she loves.</p>

<p>The truth has long before been known to
those around, who are more skilled in the art.
A particular dress is selected, which is worn
because the loved one says it is becoming; the
hair is arranged in accordance with the expression
of his approbation. Polkas are only
danced with him&mdash;songs are sung that <em>he</em>
admires&mdash;the ball-room is dull, dark, empty,
till he arrives&mdash;the fair one’s eyes, like Noah’s
dove, wander without finding a resting place&mdash;the<span class="pagenum">[8]</span>
cheek is pale and anxious. He enters; for
the first time she observes the room is in a blaze
of light. They are dancing; the music is playing;
his eye wanders; she is still anxious,
pale; he recognizes her; the young heart’s-blood
mantles her fair brow; her eyes glisten;
her suddenly vermilion-tinted cheek and lip, as
he approaches, proclaim silently but surely to
the observer that Love has lost another shaft
from his full quiver. And at this stage it is
well for loving mothers to preserve their school-room
power over their beautiful daughters.
How much misery might be afterwards spared,
if a mother’s advice were now well given and
received. A daughter’s thoughts should be
delicately anticipated. A mother’s province is
to guard, by advice, the future conduct of her
child; and of what avail will such advice be if
the parent cannot read the state of that child’s
heart. A mother should rather live over again
her own sweet dream of love, while listening to
the gentle hopes and fears of the daughter
whose confidence she has for the wisest motives
won, than by any expression repulse the young
heart that is panting, but half ashamed, to hide
her head in the bosom that nourished her, and
pour forth her soul to almost the only earthly
being whose every heartstring will truly vibrate
with her own. Ashamed! we said; why should
the young have this feeling with a mother? Is
not love the sweetest, gentlest passion we are
capable of&mdash;the great bond of life? For what
is life without love? A desert, a wilderness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[9]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Rules for Courting.</h2>
</div>


<p>1. Marriage is so <em>personal</em> a business that it
will be readily conceded that it concerns the
contracting parties more than it does relations
and friends. For this reason the gentleman
should first make sure that the affections of the
young lady would, <em>in all probability</em>, centre
upon himself, before he proposes to the parents
or guardians. He should do this without entrapping
the affections of the lady herself;
which course would, should the engagement
from family reasons fall to the ground, entail
misery upon her.</p>

<p>2. Giving presents is always allowable; but
they should be confined to trifles before an
actual engagement between the parties. Any
perishable article may be given without regard
to cost, but valuable keepsakes should be reserved.
Letters, trinkets and valuable presents,
when engagements are broken off, are always
returned by both parties.</p>

<p>3. In courting a lady with whom you were
not previously acquainted, you should always
address her as Miss So-and-so, or, in case of
much emphasis, my dear Miss So-and-so. It
is not allowable to be too familiar at first,
though if you have known her from childhood,
or have had a long intimacy in the family, you
may use her Christian name. After engagement,
use it exclusively when you address her.
This rule will apply to ladies also, when addressing
their beaux.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[10]</span></p>

<p>4. Love letters are very absurd things when
(as they sometimes are) made public. The
reason is, they concern only two persons in the
world&mdash;the writer and the receiver. They
should be plain, fervent, respectful, and to the
point. Never write a letter merely for the sake
of writing; let it always have some aim&mdash;a
message, an invitation; or let it carry news of
some kind.</p>

<p>5. In public, or in company, the conduct of
lovers should be guarded. Avoid all show of
extreme preference, and never pass compliments.
Neither caress nor chide before others,
nor call each other endearing names, such as
my dear, honey, pet, etc., etc. This rule will
apply to married people as well as to those in
the chrysalis state.</p>

<p>6. If your suit is rejected by the lady you
are expected to abandon it; and, should you
decide to try a second time to win her favor, do
not be too importunate, and never visit her
without special leave. Many ardent young
lovers lose their sweethearts irretrievably by
haunting them, when perhaps with proper management
they might have succeeded. A girl
does not always know her own mind until she
becomes disgusted.</p>

<p>7. In quarrels between lovers, the man must
always be at three-quarters of the expense of a
reconciliation; but the woman must have prepared
the way from the moment of the quarrel.
Except in cases of jealousy, a quarrel generally
begins on the side of the woman. She is angry<span class="pagenum">[11]</span>
at first with herself, or because familiarity with
you begins to produce ennui, or because she is
too sure of you. In place of giving quarrel for
quarrel, it is sufficient, in such a case, to excite
her imagination, to disquiet her heart, to arouse
her suspicions, and all the little doubts and
fears which prevent the current of true love
from running smoothly.</p>

<p>8. Caprice is a peculiarity of lovers that is
often mistaken for inconstancy, while they are
really very different. The one is a weakness
of the heart, the other a calculation of the
mind. Caprice is the source of a thousand
little disputes, which in themselves are felicities.
It ravishes from love all that is lively, gracious
and gay. It is a pardonable weakness in
woman.</p>

<p>9. In attending balls, neither the lady or the
gentleman should dance with a strange partner,
except by each other’s consent. Relatives
and intimate friends may be taken as partners
without this formality. If the gentleman introduces
a friend to his sweetheart she may
consider this introduction as a tacit consent to
her dancing with him; and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice versa</i> as
regards the lady.</p>

<p>10. During courtship, should a gentleman
meet one of his male friends at a party, he is
not obliged by etiquette to introduce his intended
bride to him. He can do as he pleases
about it, and should always ask the lady’s
consent previous to such introduction. The
same rule will apply to the lady, though girls<span class="pagenum">[12]</span>
are generally proud enough to introduce their
lovers, if they think much of them.</p>

<p>11. A man should never attempt to take
liberties with his sweetheart during courtship&mdash;not
even after the engagement. Such conduct
is mean, and a sign of low breeding.
Good and virtuous girls, though they are
pained and displeased, do not always resent
such treatment. Others of a more energetic
and fiery temperament are not afraid to show
their displeasure. Every young lady should
do so.</p>

<p>12. Where a young lady is shrewish and
overbearing towards her lover it will not answer
for him to yield too far to her caprices, or
she may despise him as pusillanimous. Some
girls find fault and quarrel just for the pleasure
of a reconciliation. In such a case you are
justified in opposing her to a certain extent,
but be careful and not go too far, or she may
“fly off the handle” in a pet, and make it
difficult for you to regain her favor.</p>

<p>13. A young man should never pay particular
attention to a girl he does not think of
marrying. Male coquettes are humbugs, and
the ladies should never tolerate them. If a girl
suspects the sincerity of her lover, she should
show indifference to him by “being particularly
engaged” when he calls. If he is sincere in his
attachment be will be all the more anxious for
an interview. Treat him with polite indifference,
and if he is really in love he will think it
about time to come to an understanding with
you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[13]</span></p>

<p>14. To sum up: you should never begin a
courtship until you are old enough to marry&mdash;until
you have the means, or a fair prospect of
them, to support a wife&mdash;nor until you meet
with a girl whose tastes, peculiarities, morals
and habits of thinking you admire, and you
are perfectly sure that your regard for her is
built upon reason, not upon the caprice of the
moment.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Marriage.</h2>
</div>


<p>To be happy in the married state is one of
the most important things that can engage the
attention of both sexes the world over.</p>

<p>What a lamentable fact it is that there are so
many matches made that turn out to be the
lifetime misery of both parties! This can be
avoided or prevented more by persons knowing
what kind of a partner would suit them, before
getting married.</p>

<p>To be happy in wedlock persons must be
properly mated. Every one should know what
sort of a person they want for a partner. For
instance: a gentleman who is fond of life and
amusement, and wants to enjoy everything as
much as possible, never should think of marrying
a lady who feels the happiest when she is
quietly sitting by her fireplace at home, reading
some book of science, or fretting about the
domestic affairs not being carried on to suit her.
What sort of a match would this make?</p>

<p>Neither should a lady with bright auburn
hair, and vigorous, lively constitution, unite her<span class="pagenum">[14]</span>
destiny with a light-haired, pale, sickly, thin-looking
man that prefers to take the world
easy in all things. Such a couple can never
get along happily.</p>

<p>I will here give some directions by which the
disposition of every one, male or female, may
be told; and as every one knows what sort of
a partner they want, there need not be any
more trouble in matrimonial affairs after this.</p>

<p>Persons with red hair are generally the most
affectionate, if they marry one who does not
neglect them in the little attentions due from
the one to the other in married life.</p>

<p>Usually soft, languid eyes are evidence of
voluptuous dispositions. In females, they are
thought a great beauty, and indicate an amiable,
heartfelt affection. In men, they show
but too well an effeminate disposition, and very
often they indicate a want of fidelity.</p>

<p>A man should never marry a woman older
than himself, it matters not what may be the
other considerations; and the woman who
marries a man younger than she is must not
feel disappointed if he does not prove true to
her.</p>

<p>A person with a sharp ridge on the top of the
nose is greatly endowed with the faculty of
self-defence. A good trait in man, but if in
woman, take care for quarrels when you want
your shirt buttons sewed on.</p>

<p>Look out for persons who have what is called
“hook-billed noses,” for, if such be your partner,
their rights will certainly be taken care of,
for they will do it themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[15]</span></p>

<p>A nose that is thick and broad about midway
and rather short, indicates habits of economy&mdash;a
good thing to observe in a female.</p>

<p>Those having very inquisitive dispositions
can be told by the horizontal length of the nose
from the lip forwards. A person with this sign
large is very inquisitive, asks a great many
questions, and takes means to find out the
secrets of others.</p>

<p>Those who can keep a secret may be told by
the great breadth or expansion of the nostrils.</p>

<p>A person who is suspicious, and will keep a
close watch over everything around them, has
a long nose from the root downwards, at a
right angle with the horizontal length, before
spoken of.</p>

<p>The action of love on the chin is also frequently
shown in the motion and position of
the head, a person with congeniality of feelings
and a desire to be loved always throws the chin
a little forward, with eyes that have an upward
look, as if looking at something on the side of
the wall, or in the sky. This is their habit, as
many call it.</p>

<p>A person capable of violent and ardent love
for another generally throws their chin a little
sidewise. We thus see the signs of the right
eyebrow, at the inner extremity. The upturning
of the hairs of the inner extremity of the
left eyebrow indicates one who will respect
their companion in a high degree.</p>

<p>The muscular fibres passing from the top of
the forehead to the middle of the eyebrow, causing<span class="pagenum">[16]</span>
an elevation of the brow, and the horizontal
wrinkles on each side, indicate an enthusiastic
person, and one full of hope; the first being
indicated on the left side, and hope on the right.
These are both excellent traits.</p>

<p>A jealous person may be known by an oblique
fulness below the under lip, and has a rather
pouting appearance.</p>

<p>A lady who will be apt “to wear the trousers”
can be told by a small muscle, passing from
the top of the nose to the skin of the forehead
between the eyebrows, raising short transverse
wrinkles over the root of the nose. The same
sign in a gentleman, too full, shows that he
would be rather a master than a husband.</p>

<p>A lady whose front teeth are long and well
shaped is generally very affectionate. The
same in man shows a kind disposition.</p>

<p>A fulness of the under lip, in either male
or female, extending from the angle of the
mouth obliquely, and occupying the concavity
between the lip and chin, shows a bitterness
of temper which no reasonable mind could
tolerate.</p>

<p>We think that any person, who has the ordinary
powers of observation about them, can
form an opinion from what has been here given,
so that they need never be mistaken in the
disposition of the one who is to be their bosom
companion for life, “for happiness or for woe,
through life they must go.”</p>
